    "**Model:** Consider a haploid population of size $N,$ which is composed of two alleles $A$ and $a$ present in 1 and $N - 1$ copies respectively. The fitnesses of $A$ and $a$ are $1 + s$ and 1 respectively, where $s > 0$. \n",

    "At each discrete time step, one individual is chosen proportional to its fitness from the population.\n",
    "It produces $U$ number of progenies, drawn from the offspring distribution $P_{U}$. In order to keep the population size constant in every time step, $U$ individuals are selected to die randomly from other N âˆ’ 1 individuals.\n",

    "The offspring distribution ($P_{U}(u)$) is\n",
